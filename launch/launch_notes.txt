NOTE: some nodes show up in rqt_graph that, afaik, do not appear in the .launch file. For example, move_base features prominently in the graph but only shows up as an include in the launch file. Is including a .lauch.xml file enough to launch a thing? It looks like it is, the .launch.xml file appears to be an actual launch file. Must be an xml odditiy, not a ROS thing. Oh god this include file has more include files in it D:

This is completely unacceptable, I need a legit graph on a whiteboard for who launches who else.

I think maybe all I need to run this simulation is stageros, move_base, joint_state_publisher/robot_state_publisher, and slam_gmapping. Not entirely sure though. Must read and test.


stage_ros stageros:
    *contains the model of the robot
    *subscribes to a cmd_vel topic (in our case "mobile_base/commands/velocity")
    *publishes odom and ground_truth info
    *does something(?) with tf broadcasting
    *rqt_graph shows /stageros as publishing to /tf, /base_scan, and /odom
    *I know it also subscribes to at *least* /clock and a ground_truth topic 


joint_state_publisher joint_state_publisher:
    *publishes the state of joints somehow-I think this means the wheel(?) joints
    *yes, publishes the 'position', 'velocity' and 'effort' of left_wheel_joint and _right_wheel_joint
    *rqt_graph shows it publishing to /joint_states (which robot_state_publisher subs

mobile_base_nodelet_manager:
    *publishes to "mobile_base/commands/velocity-likely the topic responsible for actually moving the robot, since stageros subscribes to it.
    *listens and publishes to all kinds of other topics which I need to sort out.
    *NOTE that it also subscribes to mobile_base/commands/velocity, so I'm not sure what publishing to that topic would do...
